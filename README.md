## Hi. I'm MVD ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Louisville-based software engineering leader, visual artist, and lifelong maker. I organize and lead distributed engineering teams through modernization work, pulling old systems into the cloud and driving observability to make data-driven decisions. While I work to enable team autonomy, I still like being close to the code, experimenting with tools like Swift/iOS, Python, TypeScript, Traditional AI/ML, being extra nice to our robot overlords to avoid being taken during the uprising, and AWS whenever I get the chance. I'm a firm advocate for automating whatever you can so that you can focus on the harder problems.

As a kid, I used to take apart remote controls just to see the circuits, and pull pans out of the cabinets to play them like an instrument; not much has changed. Now itâ€™s software tinkering, woodworking, and whatever half-finished electronics project is sitting on my bench. I love learning new things, experimenting, and researching.

Art is the other side of the same coin for me; painting, sculpture, or interactive pieces that usually start as experiments and sometimes turn into something I like. The overlap between engineering and the creative arts is where Iâ€™m most at home.
