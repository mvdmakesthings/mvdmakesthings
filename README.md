## Hi. I'm MVD ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Louisville-based Director of Software Engineering, visual artist, and lifelong maker. I lead distributed engineering teams through modernization work, pulling old systems into the cloud and making them behave. I still like being close to the code, experimenting with tools like LangGraph, Claude Code, and AWS whenever I get the chance.

As a kid, I used to take apart remote controls just to see the circuits, and not much has changed. Now itâ€™s camper vans, furniture, and whatever half-finished electronics project is sitting on my bench.

Art is the other side of the same coin for meâ€”painting, sculpture, or interactive pieces that usually start as experiments and sometimes turn into something I like. The overlap between engineering and art is where Iâ€™m most at home.
